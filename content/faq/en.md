## Paris.js

### What is Paris.js?

Paris.js is a **community** of **JavaScript developers** - beginners or experts, professionals or hobbyists.
Paris.js organizes a meetup **every last Wednesday of the month** with speakers from the community. Each event ends with food, drinks and time for members to exchange ideas, chat, and network.

### Who is Paris.js?

**You are!** Paris.js is not affiliated with any company and doesn’t have any “official” status. The community exists on its own and is managed by those who are interested in getting involved. As a community, it’s important for us to be **free and independent**.

### Is Paris.js brand new?

No, it is not. The first event was held way **back in October 2010**.

### How can I contribute to the community?

There are multiple ways to get involved in the Paris.js organization:

* [present a talk](#how-can-i-submit-a-talk)
* [have your company host a meetup](#i-want-to-host-a-meetup)
* [Make a donation](#funding)
* join in on organizational discussions
* help maintain and develop the website

The easiest way to get started is by sending a message to the mailing list, slack channel or meet volunteers at the next event.

### Paris.js / France.js / Apéro.js / Whatever.js

While there are no “official” ties between Paris.js and other Paris-based Javascript meetups, we’re all quite friendly and many contributors to Paris.js are also involved in other meetups. Paris.js happily promotes and spreads the word about other similar events.

### How can I be informed about what’s happening with Paris.js?

You can find more on [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Paris-js/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/parisjs), and the [mailing-list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/parisjs) or [slack channel](https://slack-francejs.now.sh/) (via France.js).

## The “Meetups”

### What do meetups talk about?

We focus most heavily on **Javascript-related** topics, but we may also explore a wider array of **front-end** tech topics from time to time. Additionally, we have had speakers **dive into their experience as entrepreneurs**. Essentially, we consider anything that could pique the interest of modern developers under our potential umbrella.

### When is the next meetup?

Meetups usually happen **every last Wednesday of the month**.
We usually don't have meetups during the lowest month of summer and in December.

### How can I attend? Is it free?

All events are **free**! We open registration on meetup.com about a week before each event. To attend, you simply need to register - but be quick, tickets are generally gone within a day.

### How can I submit a talk?

First off, thanks a bunch - speakers are crucial to what we do! We generally propose two types of talks:

* **lightning talks (5 minutes)**: generate enthusiasm; demo something neat
* **full length talks (20 minutes)**: dig deeper in a topic; do a live-coding session

The easiest way to submit a talk is through [our dedicated form](/en/submission/talk).
Please do not submit any commercial talks.

### How are talks chosen?

Talks are selected 2 weeks before the event (second week of the month). Popular talks are chosen via a public Hangout which is announced on the mailing-list. Everyone can upvote the talks on GitHub [Parisjs/talks](https://github.com/parisjs/talks)..

### I want to host a meetup!

We are always looking for new companies to host our meetups. The only (small!) conditions are:

* the venue should be large enough for 50+ attendees.
* it should be located within the borders of Paris city.

At the beginning of the event, you will get some time to introduce your company and recruitment opportunities. [See sponsors page](/en/sponsors)

## Sponsoring, Publicity

### I want to sponsor a meetup!

The only way to “sponsor” is by hosting a meetup. See “I want to host a meetup”.

### Can you advertise my event to your members?

The rule of thumb is that we do not do advertisements for paid events. If the event is free and is on a topic related to Paris.js, we’d be happy to talk about it. Just send a message through meetup.com or on our mailing list.

### Funding

In the same spirit of openness and sharing, we have opened a page on [opencollective](https://opencollective.com/parisjs).
You can contribute financially to Paris.js by making a donation. It offers no compensation.
Our annual budget is low, the extra money will be used to create goodies, gifts for speakers, pay a last minute buffet.
To avoid creating a structure, we rely on an external [host](https://opencollective.com/faq/collectives#what-is-a-host-do-i-need-one-), opencollective.fr (https://www.societe.com/societe/opencollective-paris-oc-842144263.html). It is this association that manages the money and makes the transfers to reimburse the expenses.

### I’m looking for JS devs, can you help?

If you’re looking for JS developers, we’ve got you covered:

* publish a job offer on our [LinkedIn group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/3852602)
* sponsor the meetup and let us that you are looking for new teammates
* or just come by at a meetup and meet the attendees :)
